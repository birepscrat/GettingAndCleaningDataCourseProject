#README: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

##by Birepscrat

This repo contains **run_analysis.R**, an R script for downloading, cleaning, and summarizing data
from [UCI's HAR dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).

*Davide Anguita, Alessandro Ghio, Luca Oneto, Xavier Parra and Jorge L. Reyes-Ortiz. Human Activity     Recognition on Smartphones using a Multiclass Hardware-Friendly Support Vector Machine. International Workshop of Ambient Assisted Living (IWAAL 2012). Vitoria-Gasteiz, Spain. Dec 2012

It was created as part of Johns Hopkins University's 10 course professional
certificate in Data Science.

If you already have the dataset create a directory called ".data" and place your
"UCI HAR Dataset" directory there, then set the cwd to the parent of .data 
and run the script. 

If you don't preload the data be aware the dataset (roughly ~60mb)
will be downloaded the first time you run the script.

Our result is included as **Analyzed_Data.txt**

**CodeBook.md** describes our process and the data.

Finally there is this file, **README.md**, with information on the project
contained in this repo.
